# Capistrano::Composer

Composer support for Capistrano 3.x

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.1.0'
gem 'capistrano-composer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano-composer

## Usage

Require the module in your `Capfile`:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/composer'
```

`capistrano/composer` comes with 5 tasks:

* composer:install
* composer:install_executable
* composer:dump_autoload
* composer:self_update
* composer:run

The `composer:install` task will run before deploy:updated as part of
Capistrano's default deploy, or can be run in isolation with:

```bash
$ cap production composer:install
```

By default it is assumed that you have the composer executable installed and in your
`$PATH` on all target hosts.

### Configuration

Configurable options, shown here with defaults:

```ruby
set :composer_install_flags, '--no-dev --no-interaction --quiet --optimize-autoloader'
set :composer_roles, :all
set :composer_project_dir, ''
set :composer_dump_autoload_flags, '--optimize'
set :composer_download_url, "https://getcomposer.org/installer"
set :composer_version, '1.0.0-alpha8' #(default: not set)
```

### Installing composer as part of a deployment

Add the following to `deploy.rb` to manage the installation of composer during
deployment (composer.phar is install in the shared path).

```ruby
SSHKit.config.command_map[:composer] = "php #{shared_path.join("composer.phar")}"

namespace :deploy do
  after :starting, 'composer:install_executable'
end
```

### Accessing composer commands directly

This library also provides a `composer:run` task which allows access to any
composer command.

From the command line you can run

```bash
$ cap production composer:run['status','--profile']
```

Or from within a rake task using capistrano's `invoke`

```ruby
task :my_custom_composer_task do
  invoke "composer:run", :update, "--dev --prefer-dist"
end
```

### Removing the default install task

If you do not want to run the default install task on `deploy:updated`, (for 
example, if you do not have root level dependencies stored in a `composer.json`
you can remove it by adding the following line to your `config/deploy.rb`:

```ruby
Rake::Task['deploy:updated'].prerequisites.delete('composer:install')
```

You can then call `composer.install` task within your own defined tasks, at an 
appropriate juncture.
